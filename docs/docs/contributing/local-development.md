## Using virtual environments

Virtualenv is the most common and easy to install tool for virtual environments. Itâ€™s a great tool for beginners.

```terminal
python3 -m venv dbt-env             # create the environment
source dbt-env/bin/activate         # activate the environment for Mac and Linux
dbt-env\Scripts\activate            # activate the environment for Windows
```

If you install dbt in a virtual environment, you need to reactivate that same virtual environment each time you create a shell window or session.
